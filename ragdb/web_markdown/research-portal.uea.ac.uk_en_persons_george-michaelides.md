Accepting PhD Students
PhD projects
I am interested in PhD candidates who want to conduct research in areas of employee well-being, self-regulation and job design. I am particularly interested in research projects that want to use intensive longitudinal data (e.g. experience sampling, or diary methods) and advanced data analysis approaches.

### Academic Background
George Michaelides obtained his PhD in Business and Management at the University Nottingham examining the dynamics of knowledge sharing in open source communities. Before joining the Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia he worked at the Institute of Work Psychology at the University of Sheffield, the Nottingham Trent University, the London School of Economics, and at Birkbeck, University of London.
His past research was based on two large scale projects examining teamwork in software engineering teams, and how the organizational context affects individual well-being. His current research focuses on the dynamics of well-being and motivation in organizations, seeking to understand how well-being and motivation change over short and long time scales and what are the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that can affect the change process. George is also passionate about Bayesian data analysis and the application of computational methods for modelling dynamic processes in work psychology.
