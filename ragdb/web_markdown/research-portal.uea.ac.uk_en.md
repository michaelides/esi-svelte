## About UEA
A research-intensive institution, UEA is ranked in the world’s top 50 for citations in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2021. We are 10th in the UK for quality of research outputs (Times Higher REF 2014 analysis) and UK Top 25 for research quality (Times Higher REF 2014 analysis). UEA research is embedded in our outstanding teaching and connects our world-leading academics with society, government and industry. We have strong collaborative research links across the Norwich Research Park and in terms of number of most highly cited scientists, Norwich is ranked fourth in the UK. Focused around six themes, our research spans the global challenges: from meeting the needs of an ageing population, to understanding the unique and fragile environments we live in, to tackling energy, food and water security so we can make the best use of our planet’s resources. Our interdisciplinary approach, and the international reach of our research, ensures UEA is well placed to continue to address significant research questions and make real impact on the world. UEA is consistently ranked in the top 25 of UK university league tables (such as The Sunday Times 2021 and Complete University Guide 2022), and recently received Gold in the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF 2017-2021). 
##  UN Sustainable Development Goals
